* Has this Ever Happened to You?

* Unit Testing Your App is Not Enough
- Doesn't test...
  - Full scenarios (i.e. acceptance or end-to-end testing)
  - User experience (perf and UI)
* But What's the Worst That Could Happen?
- Lots after a browser upgrade!
  - Perf can change dramatically
  - Look and feel can change
* Example: Significant Perf Change Related to SVG Rendering

* So What are Some UI Testing Best Practices?
- Multiple versions of the same browser
- Multiple browsers (e.g. Chrome, Safari, and Edge)
- Testing a core set of functionality regularly, measuring performance and UI changes
- Automated testing with video recording
* SAAS to the Rescue! (Right?)
- **Examples**: BrowserStack, LambdaTest
- **Advantages**: Easy to use and setup, always up-to-date, feature-packed
- **Disadvantages**: Expensive and sometimes requires monthly subscriptions
* Or Just Use Selenoid
- Ideal for small shops
- Free and open source
- Very easy setup
- LOTS of features
- Easier than Selenium Grid ;-)
